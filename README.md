# Newslix - News aggregate

Small news application using React + Redux and Newsapi.org. On the left bar, the user can choose a country for which news will be fetched. On the navbar there is the switch, news can be displayed in the list or tailes. I added English, Polish and Ukrainian translations using i18next. The application is mobile-friendly :)
